# Team Profile Generator

# DESCRIPTION
### In this assigment I've created a Team Profile Generator. 
### This is some of the requirements:
    - I am prompted for my team members and their informationand an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

    -  I click on an email address in the HTMLand my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

    - I click on the GitHub username then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

    -  start the application and I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
    
    - I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

    - I select the engineer option then I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

    - I select the intern option then I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

    - I decide to finish building my team then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
